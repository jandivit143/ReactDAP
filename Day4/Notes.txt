on day 4:
-> Convert LoginForm to work with only one state and that too of Object
-> Parent Component to Child Component communication using instance method
-> Passing data using props and context(check 01usingProps.jsx and 02usingContext.jsx files)
-> Life cycle methods() - class component - real life example is while the end user watches a live video, user may get the
   whatsapp notification
   We have 3 phases:
      Mounting - putting elements into the DOM
      Updating - component is getting updated
      Unmounting - component is being removed from the DOM

   Initializing
        Constructor

   Mounting
        getDerivedStateFromProps()
        render()
        componentDidMount()

   Updating
        getDerivedStateFromProps()
        shouldComponentUpdate()
        render()
        getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
        componentDidUpdate()

   Unmounting
        componentWillUnmount()
-> To make use of life cycle methods in functional components, we are gonna make use of react hook useEffect()
